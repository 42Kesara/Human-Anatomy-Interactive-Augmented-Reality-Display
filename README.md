# 🦴 Human Anatomy Interactive Augmented Reality Display
## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Human Anatomy Interactive Augmented Reality Display**! 🎉 This AR educational application revolutionizes the way we learn about human anatomy by transforming complex 3D structures into an engaging, interactive experience. Say goodbye to traditional 2D illustrations and immerse yourself in the fascinating world of human anatomy! 🧠

## Key Features

- **🖼️ Marker-based 3D Model Visualization**: Leverage Vuforia's image recognition to detect anatomical markers, allowing you to overlay accurate 3D models of organs, muscles, and bones in real time.

- **🤲 Intuitive Interaction**: Manipulate 3D models effortlessly with touch gestures like pinch-to-zoom and swipe-to-rotate, enhancing your understanding of spatial relationships and body functions.

- **🔊 Informative Audio Guidance**: Enjoy narrated introductions and explanations that guide you through the AR experience, providing valuable insights into anatomy and physiology with spatial audio cues.

- **📚 Flexible Learning Modes**: Perfect for medical schools, biology classrooms, or individual learners. Easily integrate new models and customize the interface for tailored learning experiences.

## Project Background

This project is a culmination of our efforts in the CCS4361: Immersive Technology Development course at the university. Our aim was to harness cutting-edge visualization and interaction technologies to create a tool that enhances anatomy learning. 🎓
